eeg bids, an extension to the brain imaging dta structure for
electroencephalography

brain imaging data structure
    originally developed for imagining data

FAIR principles
    findability
    accessibility
        addressed by repos that build on BIDS (eg, openneuro.org)
    interoperability
    reusability

requires rich metadata in dedicated 'sidecar' files

'each subject's data corresponds to a directory of raw data containing
subdirectories for each session and data modality'
(see img in dir)

## COMPONENTS

json
    dataset_description.json
        contains generic information about dataset
        looks like there's just one of these for the whole project in the
        root directory
    eeg.json
        exhaustively specifies the eeg-relevant details
        looks like there's one of these for each subject

./sourcedata
    optional directory
    supplies original, non-formatted data

./stimuli
./code
    allow data conversion and preprocessing to be reproduced

./subject*/eeg/
    contains EEG and metadata
    naming pattern:
        sub-XX_task-YY_eeg.<extension>
    sub-XX_task-YY_electrodes.tsv
        describes parameters of data acquisition
    sub-XX_task-YY_electrodes.tsv & sub-XX_task-YY_coordsystem.json
        should be specified if opsitions of electrodes are known
