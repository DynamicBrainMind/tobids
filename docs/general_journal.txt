    let's see if i can get to a minimum viable product today
    i will need to ensure that this script will run correctly if called
    from anywhere...
    
    huge issues trying to get this pyedflib to correctly do a numpy import
    doing a forced reinstall of numpy seemed to work
        conda install --force-reinstall numpy

    behavioral data appears to truly just be responses to probes
        actual rating
        RT
        onset / offset
    so i'll proceed without demographics for now..

    good progress today
    left off after initializing a readme

    this site is very helpful
        https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/files.html
    also very helpful, lists which fields are required
        https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/03-electroencephalography.html

    let's just go through and get as much of the info as i can
        optional fields i can't find i can add in as blanks
        required fields i cant find can be added with '???'

    okay yea, their main documentation page has all the info needed to get
    this organized
    still some open questions about how best to query everything from the
    mne api
    and i should prob go through the behavioral data to see what i can get
    from that (eg, demographics, task name)

    but otherwise we're ready to start thinking about a processing flow
    here

    reading in data to object called eeg
    lots of good stuff in 
        eeg.info
        eeg.info['chs']
    raw data i think is
        eeg.get_data()

    mne has functions to convert brainvision to bids
        https://mne.tools/mne-bids/dev/auto_examples/convert_eeg_to_bids.html

        want to check carefully to see whether we'll need to customize
        anything / want more control

        i kind of like the idea of just doing it custom

    not sure whether electrode coordinates are represented anywhere

    i don't totally understand bids' distinction between electrodes and
    channels
        maybe channels are the voltage of electrodes against reference?

    i think you can get electrode positions with:
        montage = eeg.get_montage()
        montage.get_positions()
        gives you a dict with coordinates for each electrode
        need to confirm that's actually coming from the data and not some
        estimate

    need to figure out what's ground and reference
        ooohh they wouldn't show up in channels
        only electrodes
        and in the header file i see gnd and ref at the bottom
