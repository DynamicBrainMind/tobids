    this site is very helpful
        https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/files.html
    also very helpful, lists which fields are required
        https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/03-electroencephalography.html

    let's just go through and get as much of the info as i can
        optional fields i can't find i can add in as blanks
        required fields i cant find can be added with '???'

    reading in data to object called eeg
    lots of good stuff in 
        eeg.info
        eeg.info['chs']
    raw data i think is
        eeg.get_data()

    mne has functions to convert brainvision to bids
        https://mne.tools/mne-bids/dev/auto_examples/convert_eeg_to_bids.html

        want to check carefully to see whether we'll need to customize
        anything / want more control

        i kind of like the idea of just doing it custom

    not sure whether electrode coordinates are represented anywhere

    i don't totally understand bids' distinction between electrodes and
    channels
        maybe channels are the voltage of electrodes against reference?

    i think you can get electrode positions with:
        montage = eeg.get_montage()
        montage.get_positions()
        gives you a dict with coordinates for each electrode
        need to confirm that's actually coming from the data and not some
        estimate

    need to figure out what's ground and reference
        ooohh they wouldn't show up in channels
        only electrodes
        and in the header file i see gnd and ref at the bottom
